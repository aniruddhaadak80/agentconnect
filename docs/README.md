# AgentConnect documentation

This directory holds the guides and design documents for the whole system. This
page is the index: every document is listed exactly once, under its primary
area, with one line on what it covers — implementation status and ownership live
in each document's own header. When a document spans two areas, follow the
cross-references inside it.

## Guides

- [product-conventions.md](product-conventions.md) — User-facing product behavior every implementation must preserve.
- [config-file-secrets.md](config-file-secrets.md) — The `*_DATA` secret convention for file-shaped credentials (Docker config, kubeconfig).
- [self-host-caddy-https.md](self-host-caddy-https.md) — Publishing a self-hosted stack behind Caddy HTTPS.

## Working papers

[`superpowers/`](superpowers/) holds point-in-time implementation plans and
specs produced during development. They record how a change was executed, are
not kept current, and never override the designs above.
