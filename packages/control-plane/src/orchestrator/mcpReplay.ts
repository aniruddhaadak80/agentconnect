/**
 * MCP binding replay to a (re)registering relay (centralized-tool-management.md §5.2).
 *
 * `rc/mcp-assign` bindings live in relay memory and are only BROADCAST at provider
 * mutation time — so a relay that connects or reconnects later holds nothing, yet the
 * daemon's relay roster can still pick it (`desiredMcpServers`), and requests through it
 * would 401. On every relay (re)register we replay the full persisted set to just that
 * relay — the exact analog of `HookService.replayTo` / `RelayIngressManager.replayTo`.
 *
 * The frame carries the upstream credential (headers) — NEVER logged. Per-provider
 * failures are swallowed + logged so one bad row can't starve the rest of the pool.
